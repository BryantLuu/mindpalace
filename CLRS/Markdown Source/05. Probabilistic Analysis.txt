##Randomly Permuting Arrays
+ Permute by sorting
	+ Assign priorities to each element of array then sort the priorities
+ Each permutation has probability $1/n!$
	+ Showing that each element has probability of winding up in position j is 1/n (condition it on previous 
+ Randomize-in-place
	+ Swap A[i] with random from (i, n)
