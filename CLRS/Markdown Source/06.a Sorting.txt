**Comparison sorts**

+ Insertion Sort: $\Theta(n^2)$, in place, stable
+ Merge Sort: $\Theta(n log(n))$, not in place, stable
+ Heapsort: $O(n log(n))$, in place, not stable
+ Quicksort: worst-case $\Theta(n^2)$, expected $\Theta(n log(n))$, generally outperforms heapsort in practice (small constant factors), not stable
+ Has worst case lower bound of $\Omega( n log(n))$
+ Bubble-sort: $\Theta(n^2)$, stable, inplace

**Non-comparison sorts**

+ Counting sort: numbers range 0-k, can sort in $\Theta(k + n)$ by using array, stable
+ Radix: given n integers, each integer with d digits, each digit can take k possible values, can sort in $\Theta(d(n+k))$ time. If $d$ is constant and $k$ is $\Theta(n)$, runs in $\Theta(n)$ time, stable
+ Bucket sort: need distribution of numbers, can sort $n$ real numbers uniformly distributed in [0, 1) in average case $\Theta(n)$ time, worst case is $\Theta(n^2)$, stable

**Order Statistics**
$i$th order statistic of a set of $n$ numbers is $i$th smallest number in set.
